# AI

Commonly referred to as artificial intelligence, in this project we 
refer to AI as our autonomous interns that take decision on their own,
eliminating the need for user-input.

# Confusion

The name has not been chosen randomly. This was decided to reflect 
the current (2024) trend of integrating AI in every product,
without really creating any intelligent systems. In this project, our
autonomous interns may just as well have been trained to be intelligent, 
as much as they might decide pseudo-randomly, in both cases we'll call it
AI.
